# README

This app is what I worked on in Stephen Grinder's Udemy course Node with [React: Fullstack Web Development](https://github.com/StephenGrider/FullstackReactCode). It is an app that will get feedback from imaginary users of an app.

## Process

### User Flow
This is a rough guideline of what a user will do when using the app:
  - User signs in with Google OAuth.
  - User pays for email credits through Stripe.
  - User creates 'campaign' (a survey email).
  - User enters emails to send survey to.
  - Service sends email to each surveyee.
  - Surveyees click a link to take survey and provide feedback.
  - Service tabulates feedback.
  - User sees report of responses.
